## Closing Thoughts Pt. 1

One of my very valuable teaching assistants has asked me to share some thoughts...

---

1.	**Stay curious**. Ask *why* the data looks the way it does. Ask *what* could happen if you made a different choice.
2.	**Think like a decision-maker**. Numbers matter, but so does the story. Learn to communicate your findings clearly and confidently.
3.	**Don’t fear complexity but seek clarity**. Models can be powerful, but the most valuable insights are the ones people can understand and act on.
4.	**Keep learning**. Tools will change—today it’s R, Python, Tableau; tomorrow it might be something else. But your ability to think analytically and make sense of the noise? That’s your superpower.

## Sincerely,

## Request for Closing Remarks from ChatGPT

"Pretend that you are a very valuable tutor for a marketing analytics class. The students have been coming to you for help throughout the semester, but the class is coming to an end. Do you have any last thoughts/closing remarks for your students?"

## Final Thoughts

Elder Uchtdorf:

- don't let go of the ideal
- don't disregard the real

- if you wait for sorrow to end before you experience joy, you might miss joy completely
